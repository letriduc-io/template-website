# Jidox - Responsive Admin Template & UI Kit
We would like to thank you for purchasing Jidox :). The following guideline will help you to get started with the Jidox and its documentation.

#### Gulp

We've included Gulp file (gulpfile.js) to help you get started with the theme and build automation. You'll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js. Note that the detailed instructions are available in `docs/index.html` too.

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/).

To install gulp, run the following command:

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you're done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+ `gulp` - Recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` directory and starts the local server serving the theme.

#### Support

If you experience any problems with the above instruction, or if you think you've found a bug with the theme - please don't hesitate to reach out to support@coderthemes.com.
